<h1 class="beginning"> Hi, I'm Paul ðŸŒŠ</h1>

<div class="gray-section" style="padding: 5px 20px 5px 20px">

I'm actively looking for dev opportunities in the solana ecosystem (part-time while I'm still in Uni). If you'd like to talk, dm me [here](https://twitter.com/blocks_go_brr).

This is where I share some of my experiences and learnings.

I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the Technical University of Munich. I've been programming professionally for ~1.5 years (@[MaibornWolff](https://www.maibornwolff.de/en)) as a fullstack dev and am now transitioning into the blockchain industry.

To look at the code for projects like [Zoolana](https://www.zoolana.com) and the [SPL Token UI](https://www.spl-token-ui.com), go [here](https://www.github.com/paul-schaaf).

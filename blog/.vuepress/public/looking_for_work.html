                Iâ€™m looking to join a company in the US that can interview me in time for the H1B visa deadline next month. role: backend, fullstack also ok. no remote. I code with voice only. open to any industry and programming language - can do low (rust/c/assembly) and high level (python/js). If youâ€™re hiring or know someone who is, please let me know ðŸ™‚

                <br>
                <br>

                my experience so far: I just graduated from TUM with a bachelors degree in CS. I started working in software about one year before my degree programme started. I have about a year of fulltime fullstack experience in java and vue from that period.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                
                I then spent some time in crypto, created a guide to solana, helped teams like meteora and also worked for half a year on the solana framework "anchor" and what became the backpack crypto wallet, all this next to my studies. i talked a bit about my crypto experience on the first episode of the solana chewing glass podcast(<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=7WwtLtbzOCU">link</a>).
                
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Going into my final year of university, I realised I wanted to move away from crypto and started reading a lot about biology. I then wrote my thesis at the chair of computational molecular medicine at TUM. While the excursion into biology has been fun and a bio startup is still in the back of my head, I realised I mostly want to do software engineering or AI research for some time and I think Iâ€™ll start with software engineering since that is what I already know.

                Also, about two years ago i developed RSI in both arms and hands. Itâ€™s gone in the arms now but not in the hands and I cannot type properly anymore. I adapted and do 99% of coding by voice now, in combination with an eye tracker. It works well! I use talon and cursorless (<a href="https://youtu.be/NcUJnmBqHTY?si=PkS6xkM2Vbk2B0PI">check out this cool talk by the creator of cursorless</a>). I have also built and open sourced my own tooling (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/paul-schaaf/talon-filetree">https://github.com/paul-schaaf/talon-filetree</a>) Coding speed is already fast and the tech only gets better each year. copilot helps a lot too. I wrote the code and text for my thesis with voice and build my voice tooling with my voice too. I'll probably upload a video soon of my coding something by voice!

                <br>
                
                I am looking for US jobs first because of the visa deadline but if youâ€™re doing something cool, Iâ€™m in principle open to go anywhere. More info about me is on my website (<a href="https://paulx.dev">https://paulx.dev</a>). Will provide references upon request. cheers :)
